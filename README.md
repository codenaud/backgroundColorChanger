## Description
Background Color Changer is a JavaScript project that allows users to dynamically change the background color of a webpage by clicking a button. The project provides a simple and intuitive interface where users can experience the fun of random color generation.

The main functionality of Background Color Changer is based on JavaScript. Upon clicking the button, the application generates a random color code and applies it as the background color of the webpage. Additionally, the generated color code is displayed as text, allowing users to easily identify the current background color.

This project is designed to showcase the capabilities of JavaScript in manipulating the DOM and dynamically updating webpage elements. It serves as a fun and interactive way to explore the possibilities of color customization on a website.
